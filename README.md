Started my webdev journey on 14th January 2o25...not really going into it as a career tho. I found this interesting. I'm learning webdev cause of my final year project
I will be needing a web bas app for deployment. Buuuuuttt.. i think i will continue learning just for freelancing n make it a hobby or some sort..wish me luck.
